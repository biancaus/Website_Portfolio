I'm an indoor person.
I find it VERY fulfilling to be able to watch animes,
movies and do all sorts of stuff in the comfort of my home more than going out.
I LOVE food as much as I love sleep & the indoors. Food is love; food is life.
I decided to do design because ever since I was a child
I wanted to be able to draw and create things my way but also in a sense that
people could appreciate the work I have done. I want people to see through my
soul by just looking at my work.<br>
<br>
<strong>1. Made in the Philippines.</strong><br>
Yes, I am Filipino, and you are correct!
That does make me Asian, thank you very much for noticing.<br>
<br>
<strong>2. So you speak fluent Filipino.</strong><br>
I'm from down south of the country and we speak a different dialect, so,
no, Filipino is not my native tongue.<br>
<br>
<strong>3. I heard you guys eat dogs.</strong><br>
No, not all of us do. It's probably a thing in some places,
but definitely not where I came from. That's just sick, and wrong, and downright cruel.
Why would I do that :|<br>
<br>
<strong></strong>4. You sound American.<br>
I don't know why our accent gives people that idea,
but we were colonised by the Americans at some point, so, it's probably that.<br>
<br>
<strong></strong>5. Do you eat rice?<br>
Do I eat rice?! I LIVE RICE. Well, to be honest, I am trying to cut down but,
it's just so hard! I could never end my day without rice, seriously.<br>
<br>
<strong></strong>6. Tell us about your Whanau.<br>
We moved to New Zealand four years ago along with the whole family.
I'm the eldest among three siblingsâ€“ my sister's the middle child (LOL, no offense) and then,
our baby brother. Grew up in a traditional but sort of (maybe slightly) modern family,
it's a bit of both really. Let's just put it this way, we're Asian. You get the idea. #AsianParents</div>
